              I am a second-year master student at the University of Utah, currently working with Professor <a href="http://www.cemyuksel.com/" target="_blank">Cem Yuksel</a>.
              I am interested in reproducing natural phenomena in a physically-based way. My philosophy is that nature is the best artist, so simulating nature is the best way of artistic creation. To be honest, I don't like mathmatical tools for their abstraction. But when they are used to represent natural phenomena, instead I feel they are attractive. 
               <br />Hence, I'm now  focusing on physically-based simulation and physically-based rendering. It's hard to tell which one I prefer. Although both of them have their own unique principles, they have a lot common ideas for simulating the nature which I appresicate. For example, constitutive Models are just as beautiful as the rendering equation from my perspective. I believe I will continuely working on these two areas even if I choose one as my primary direction.
               <br />In my spare time, I enjoy working out, playing console games(my favorite now: Star Wars Battlefront II), reading, post rock music.

                    There are some artifacts in the ceiling acutally caused by volumetric path tracing. 
                    I didn't have enough time handling this bug then, since I only had one weekend to extend my path tracer into a volumetric path tracer. 
                    I remember Prof. Yoksel wished us to spend more time on the scene building instead of advanced features, but I ingored the warning since rendering volumes was really funny (¬‿¬) .
